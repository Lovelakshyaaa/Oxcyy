Okay, I'll add a beautiful shimmer effect to your music application to make it more engaging and visually appealing. I'll add this effect to the following widgets:

- Local Music list
- Album list
- Search results

I'll start by adding the shimmer package to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Then, I'll create a new dart file to handle all the shimmer effect logic and keep your code organized. Finally, I'll apply the shimmer effect to the widgets I've mentioned.
